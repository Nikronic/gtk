### All general advice is bad
There is no such thing as general advice. Asking someone for it os simply asking them to make up a general rule based on their own specific experience. Instead, ask people what they did and why and decide whether and how it applies to your life, yourself.

### Napkins beat spreadsheets
The more advanced the investor is the simpler his questions are. Anyone can do spreadsheets but only great investors can do napkin math. It’s the ones that get you excited by their obvious simplicity rather than hidden complexity that are the real gems.

### You can tweet your way onto a yacht
Posting online is the last vestige of the American Dream. Anyone can post their way onto yachts, jets, and the dinner tables of the rich & famous through the sheer strength of their takes, insights and analysis. Be right, be original and share widely.

### If you are making a pro/con list, you've lost
If you have to spend countless hours debating an investment idea you’ve already lost. The best investments should be easy. Where everything lines up and it all makes sense. Leave the coin flips to the speculators who are forced to deploy capital on a specific timeline.

### Quarterbacks envy nobody
The more you understand who you are, the less you’ll envy those who you aren’t. If you don’t know whether you want to be a quarterback, a chef or an artist you’ll find yourself envious of all of them. A great sign that you’ve found your calling is when you stop envying others.

### Mansions are underpriced
When you buy a mansion or jet you’re not just buying luxury, you’re buying the ability to shock and awe. Even if they share the same words, the proposal made on the deck of a yacht has a very different impact than the one made over the phone.

> I have personally reached to the point that suggests 1, 2, and 5.
