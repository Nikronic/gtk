==We don’t choose our gifts. They choose us.==

**A _mark of maturity_ is ==surrendering== to the person you actually** are instead of the one you wish you were.

The decision to surrender to your gifts is more painful than you’d think. You can’t really choose what you’re able to be excellent at because *you don't get to choose the hand that nature dealt you.*

Instead, if you’re going *to be world-class*, you have to **align yourself with your fingerprint**. In our insanely competitive world, ==surrendering to your talents== is your only chance at becoming world-class at what you do.

I suspect less than 10% of people ever surrender to who they really are. They spend their whole lives trying to fulfill a fake and manufactured image. And so, they get trapped in hollow careers and meaningless pursuits where they’re forced to be somebody they’re not — the stuff of a cold and haunting misery.

==Surrender is **terrifying at first**==. **It comes with a loss of control**. Chances are, you’ll disappoint your parents, teachers, and probably even yourself. If you’re doing it right, you may even pursue low-status projects.

> This is particularly true about me. I have been constantly bullied by my family for decisions I made. An example of this was that why I have no income while I was studying MSc and doing research (even though I had contract but because of US sanctions I could not get paid). So I get bullied every time why I am in my 20s but no income; I was told I should have become a government employee and I would have a (shitty!) car.
> It is going to be about 4 years since that, I am still doing what I think I love.

Hate to break it to you, but the vision you’ve always had for your future also won’t come true because that vision was predicated on the person you wish you were, not the person you actually are.

==What feels like **the death of your dreams is actually the birth of something** much more profound.==

==**There’s ease on the other side of surrender**.==
