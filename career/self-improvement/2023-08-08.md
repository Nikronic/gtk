>[!question] So, I would like to paraphrase the question:
 What's a simple question that lets you learn a lot about _**yourself**_?

> Are you running from or chasing toward?

> “In what ways has God punished you for the sins of your parents?”
> > “By making me repeat them.”

> I like to ask a person what their favorite thing about themselves is…. Helps you learn what they value
> > It also just makes people feel great about themselves 😌😌

> What you had been so sure and later switched your understanding and why?
> > In many cases some of your worldviews will flip more than once before become relatively stable. This can be an indication of *maturity level*

> "What question do you wish more people asked you?"

> I think your question -> What’s a simple question that lets you learn a lot about someone? 
> > [!info] You realise what’s important to ppl by the question they choose.
