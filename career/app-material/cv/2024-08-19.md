## How to Write a Resume That Doesn't Suck

The article itself is short and to the point; So I suggest reading it in full.

Here are some comments that are interesting to know:

>[!warning] Avoid generic summary
>a format like this: \[Job area\] expert with X years of experience, specializing in \[function A\], \[function B\], and \[function C\] is generic and in fact not having it is better.
>
>There’s only really a point in doing it if it’s going to be something really differentiating about you. --The author of article

>The line my resume writing coach told me was did you either 1. bring in revenue/members/whatever is considered “top line” in your organization or 2. save money?
>
I am not a producer. I am a saver-of-money, by reducing risk. So that’s what I emphasize, completion of projects that reduced risk for clients.
