>[!success] A’s Hire A’s, B’s Hire C’s

It is long understood that much can be learned about an organization by the people **who are hired**. Simply put, hiring (and retaining) the [**best employees**](https://www.theleadermaker.com/keeping-the-best-employees/) make for a better organization.

The finest employees do not fear others who are the best and often enjoy the professional competition and camaraderie of others like them.

> Donald Rumsfeld[^1] notes that “A’s hire A’s, B’s hire C’s” and maybe even hire a few “D’s.”

He explains, as others have, that talented and hard working people help create a [**positive work culture**](https://www.theleadermaker.com/characteristic-12-drive-a-positive-culture/); "culture of excellence".

>[!info] culture of excellence
>The best employees, those he calls “A’s,” are smart, experienced, and savvy people who know other A’s and can call upon them to consider for a job vacancy.

The average employee knows they are not the best. Those less talented, he calls them **“B’s,” are reluctant to hire people who might “outshine” them**. Alas, these employees do not know the best people outside their organization or likely to know people like themselves. Thus they hire C’s, those with even less competence.

I will add that when A’s make an error hiring the wrong person they are more likely to repair the error.  B’s who make the same error are more disposed to avoid taking action on the problem.

>[!success] The lesson
> the best people hire the best people, average people hire mediocre people.

The problem with too many marginal people in an organization is that the workplace starts to deteriorate, production slips, the working environment is less professional, the best people start to feel marginalized (see [**The Bias Against Achievement**](https://www.theleadermaker.com/the-bias-against-achievement/)), and teamwork suffers.  Eventually, the best employees leave and the organization will no longer attract the best.

>[!info] What to do?
>Senior leaders in organizations should:
>- identify their best employees
>- let them do the hiring of other star level employees
>- encourage and recognize their successes
>
>>[!note]
>>Leaders know this intuitively and the best employees will only need encouragement and authority.
