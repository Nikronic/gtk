>[!danger] Time tracking software causing micromanagement is horrible for creative works

Well, generally in SWE, or any other problem solving work that requires *creative work* not manual labor, time tracking just a doomsday and must be prevented at all costs (no one that values their work rather getting just paid accepts this). Especially, when most of the time, the solutions are found while walking rather than sitting behind a desk and smashing the keyboard.

>[!success] But if it exists (manual mode), it is a tool for *push back*
>One can use the reports produced by time tracking software as an argument for pushing back requests from upper management regarding changes to work. Well, if the team spend the maximum time for a feature, request any change for the current milestone (same work days) is not acceptable as it causes burnout (assuming constantly this happens with no rewards.)

Some cases from the legends on the reddit:

>...My team has used it to show how many hours different things take up. This allows us to push back when "the business" wants to throw something else at us. Before Clockify, we didn't have any actual data to push back with ([ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qnfuds/comment/hjgd10m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

> We use clockify, it's manual entry so that just goes in as part of dev time. What's important is the company's attitude. You could have a company like I do that has time tracking but other than finance reminding each month to fill out, it has zero impact and isn't monitored. Or you could have a company with no time tracking that micromanages and has a draconian approach to employees.

Something interesting is that almost resigns come right after adding such tracking tools (assuming micromanagement behavior and not manual one for finance or estimate of work)
