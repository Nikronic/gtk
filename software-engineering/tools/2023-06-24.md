# How to Write a Git Commit Message
ref: [CBEAMS | git-commit](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

The most basic element of keeping a healthy commit history: **how to write an individual commit message**

---
## 1 Introduction: Why good commit messages matter
If you haven’t given much thought to what makes a great Git commit message, it may be the case that you haven’t spent much time using `git log` and related tools.

>[!note] There is a vicious cycle here:
> because the commit history is unstructured and inconsistent, one doesn’t spend much time using or taking care of it. And because it doesn’t get used or taken care of, it remains unstructured and inconsistent.

Benefits:
- `git blame`, `revert`, `rebase`, `log`, `shortlog` and other subcommands come to life
- reviewing others’ commits and pull requests can be done **independently**
- **Understanding why something happened** months or years ago becomes not only possible but efficient.

A project’s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his project’s log. It’s worth taking the time to learn how to care for one properly. 

>[!success] Habit of caring about git log tools
>What may be a hassle at first soon becomes habit, and eventually a source of pride and productivity for all involved.

In order to create a useful revision history, **teams should first agree on a *commit message convention*** that defines at least the following three things:

- **Style.** Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation. Spell these things out, remove the guesswork, and make it all as simple as possible. The end result will be a remarkably consistent log that’s not only a pleasure to read but that actually _does get read_ on a regular basis.
- **Content.** What kind of information should the body of the commit message (if any) contain? What should it _not_ contain?
- **Metadata.** How should issue tracking IDs, pull request numbers, etc. be referenced?

## 2 The seven rules of a great Git commit message
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### 2.1 Separate subject from body with a blank line
If the reader wonders what the change was, he can simply take a look at the change itself, i.e. use `git show` or `git diff` or `git log -p`.

The separation of subject from body pays off when browsing the log. Here’s the full log entry:
```shell
$ git log
commit 42e769bdf4894310333942ffc5a15151222a87be
Author: Kevin Flynn <kevin@flynnsarcade.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 1982 -0200

 Derezz the master control program

 MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
 This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
 and turns it back into a chess game.
```

And now `git log --oneline`, which prints out just the subject line:
```shell
$ git log --oneline
42e769 Derezz the master control program
```

Or, `git shortlog`, which groups commits by user, again showing just the subject line for concision:
```shell
$ git shortlog
Alan Bradley (1):
      Introduce security program "Tron"

Ed Dillinger (3):
      Rename chess program to "MCP"
      Modify chess program
```

### 2.2 Limit the subject line to 50 characters
Keeping subject lines at this length ensures that they are readable, and forces the author to think for a moment about the most concise way to explain what’s going on.

>[!note] Follow atomic commits
>If you’re having a hard time summarizing, you might be committing too many changes at once. Strive for [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/) (a topic for a separate post).

>[!success] Char limit
>So shoot for 50 characters, but consider 72 the hard limit.

### 2.3 Capitalize the subject line
Begin all subject lines with a capital letter.

### 2.4 Do not end the subject line with a period
Trailing punctuation is unnecessary in subject lines.

### 2.5 Use the imperative mood in the subject line
_Imperative mood_ just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”

>[!success]
>A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
>
> > **If applied, this commit will `your subject line here`**
> 
> >[!example]
> >- If applied, this commit will _refactor subsystem X for readability_
> >- If applied, this commit will _update getting started documentation_

>[!note] 
>Use of the imperative is important only in the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you’re writing the body.

### 2.6 Wrap the body at 72 characters
Git never wraps text automatically; mind its right margin, and wrap text manually.

### 2.7 Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
Explain **what changed and why**; leave out details about how a change has been made:

>[!success] why you made the change
>Just focus on making clear the reasons why you made the change in the first place—the way things worked before the change (and what was wrong with that), the way they work now, and why you decided to solve it the way you did
