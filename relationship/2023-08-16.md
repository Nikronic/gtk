Relationship tip: when your partner makes an awful but innocent mistake (leaves their phone in the cab, forgets their passport when heading to the airport for an international flight, drops and shatters a beloved item, gets in a fender bender, etc.), **don't get mad at them**. It makes no sense (it was accidental) and it accomplishes nothing except supplementing an already bad situation with an unnecessary fight. Instead, think about it like this: as a couple, you will commit like 20 of these hideous mistakes a year and who knew that one of them was gonna happen today, but it did, so that sucks, but it's also a little bit funny, and let's just make the best of it. **This turns those moments from relationship-damaging to relationship-building.** And of course, **what goes around comes around—you do dumb things too**, and you'd much rather your partner be a laughing teammate than an angry parent in those situations. I didn't used to do this, I learned it from my wife. I am a frequent committer of hideous mistakes, and it surprised me that she never got mad about it, and then I started being like that too.
