I personally have always said that if *two exact same people* (let's say clones) start doing the same job, but one loves the job and the other one doesn't, then the person who loves the job would be way more successful. *If it is something you like you will return even it annoys the hell of you once in a while; this is particularly important since every single problem in the world has its up and downs, funs and boredoms, etc. So, when things get disastrous, those who like what they do won't give up soon, and come back again and again.*

>In the early 1980s, the sociologist Daniel Chambliss spent 5 years studying swimmers at every level of ability. In 1989, he published his research in a paper, “The Mundanity of Excellence.” Essentially, Chambliss found that Olympic champions don’t train more than the average swimmer. Instead, they train differently. In particular, they do “what others see as boring.” Chambliss tells the story of a group of coaches from around the world visiting a U.S. Olympic Team practice. “The visiting coaches were excited at first…then soon they grew bored, walking back and forth, glancing down at their watches, wondering, after the long flight out to California, when something dramatic was going to happen.” “They all have to come to see what we do,” the U.S. Olympic Team coach said. “They think we have some big secret.”

>>[!success] There is no secret
>>There is only the doing of the mundane, boring, torturous work, day after day. **Find the mundane, boring, torturous work you like**, as Seinfeld said, "and you’ll do well."
