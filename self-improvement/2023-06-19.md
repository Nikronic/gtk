### Compound yourself
>Your rate of learning should always be high

You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.

### Have almost too much self-belief
Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief.

>Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. 
>Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.

I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not.

### Learn to think independently
“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way.
> You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.

One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution.

### Get good at “sales”
Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.

>All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. 

You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.

- Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. 
- My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important.

### Make it easy to take risks
Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward.

Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time:
- try many things
- adapt quickly

> say "yes" to everything before 30s, say "no" to everything after 30s (explore vs exploit)

It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks.

> Don’t save up for too long, though.

At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (t’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.)

> Keep your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can.

### Focus
Focus is a force multiplier on work. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your **small handful of priorities accomplished quickly**.
>I have yet to meet a *slow-moving person* who is very successful.

### Work hard
You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either **smart or hard**, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 
> **99th** percentile requires both.

- Extreme people get **extreme results**.
- it’s often really fun: One of the great joys in life is finding **your purpose**, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself
- You have to figure out how to work hard **without burning out**: find
	- **work you like** doing with;
	- **people you enjoy** spending a lot of time with
-  In fact, **work stamina** seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.
- **Hard work compounds like interest**, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off.

### Be bold
>Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.

If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.

### Be willful
>Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.

>[!note] my note

>apparently, it works like a shifted sharp sigmoid function, most of the time you hear no, but if you hear yes, you get something big! (remember the NPR story about difference between "chance and luck; the book writer on the airplane story where a random person on an airplane became her publisher because she just talked about it")


> To be willful, you have to be optimistic

hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.

### Be hard to compete with
>If you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.
>The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage.

If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. Build up leverage with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields.

### Build a network
>Great work requires teams.

The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes **the limiter** for what you can accomplish.

Building up a network:
- **help** people as much as you can
- develop a **reputation for really taking care of the people** who work with you: Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x.
  >how to **evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles**. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.)
  >pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could
- **Work with the people that cover your weaknesses**; Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses.
- Get good at **discovering undiscovered talent**:
  >The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t.
  >Look for **rate of improvement** vs current experience
  > >[!note] Personal note

### You get rich by owning things
The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries.
> > [!note] Personal note
> > You want to **own equity**, and even better, do the **cash flow**. Salary is shit.

This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.
>make things people want at scale.

### Be internally driven
Most people are primarily externally driven; **they do what they do because they want to impress other people.** Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior.
- You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing.
- Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.
>hey do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.
> >[!note] Personal note
> >If you get to socioeconomically status of X, would you be happier by getting X+Y? No, external motive is very limited after a level.

This is why the question of a **person’s motivation is so important**. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. 
> Jessica Livingston and **Paul Graham** are my benchmarks for this

It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.

>One of the biggest reasons I'm excited about **basic income** is the amount of human potential it will unleash by **freeing more people to take risks**.
>
>Until then, **if you aren't born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can take big swings.** 
>
>**If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult** :(
> >[!note] Personal note
> >This is my great strength, and I should stop hiding it.
> >I grew up in extreme poverty, it almost entirely killed my creativity and strength for taking the risk. But *science* was the passion and love of my life that kept me going; lack of emotional and economical support from my family; terrible place of living, zero governmental support and many other things made everything much harder. Thankfully I had great friends, they helped me a lot and I owe them a lot. Hopefully I will survive, although not much left of my will to live (less than a year; at max 3 years)

>It is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I've witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it's possible.
