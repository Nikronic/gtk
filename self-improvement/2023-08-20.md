The interesting challenge is that, many know the issue but the will to fix this is not existence. I mean, many times we can argue we didn't know what would be the best course of action, but for issues such this, we exactly know, but somehow we fail to do so.

I believe this is one of those things that initially it has no gain, but when you start it, after a while it starts to give back and build to something tangible and strong.

Introduce yourself, say "you enjoying this?" or "this is really boring, right?" If it goes badly, it goes badly, they probably won't remember it, so don't feel like you're a burden. If it goes well, that's fantastic, you've made a friend, you've accomplished something, easy as that.
